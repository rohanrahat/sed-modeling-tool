I'm developing an interactive Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) Modeling Visualization tool for astrophysics students. This web-based application will help students understand how different stellar populations and dust attenuation affect a galaxy's spectrum. The project is inspired by Problem Set 4 from ASTRO 650 - Galactic Structure and Evolution, specifically questions 1 and 2, which deal with stellar population models and fitting galaxy spectra. 
Reference Materials: 
1. astro650_hw4.pdf: Contains the original problem set questions and context. 2. HW_4_Code.pdf: Includes Python code that partially implements the solution to question 2. 
Project Goals: 
1. Create an interactive web application using React that allows students to: - Combine different Simple Stellar Population (SSP) models - Apply dust attenuation to the combined spectrum - Fit the resulting model to an observed galaxy spectrum 
2. Provide visual feedback and educational content to enhance learning 
Detailed Implementation Plan:
1. Project Setup 
- Create a new React application 
- Set up a GitHub repository 
- Install dependencies (Plotly.js/Recharts, react-dropzone, mathjs, tailwindcss) 2. Data Preparation 
- Convert SSP models to JSON format 
- Prepare example galaxy spectra 
- Create a utility for parsing spectrum files 
3. Core Components Structure 
- Develop main SEDModelingTool component and sub-components 
4. SSP Model Management 
- Implement useSSPModels custom hook 
- Create SSP interpolation functions 
5. Spectrum Plotting 
- Develop useSpectrumPlot custom hook 
- Implement interactive plot features 
6. Model Fitting Logic 
- Create useModelFit custom hook 
- Implement dust attenuation and SSP combination functions 
7. User Interface Implementation 
- Design layout with Tailwind CSS 
- Create interactive elements (sliders, buttons, file upload) 
8. Interactive Features 
- Set up real-time model updating 
- Implement event handlers 
9. Educational Content 
- Create expandable explanation panels 
- Add hover tooltips and guided tour 
10. Results Calculation and Display 
- Implement stellar mass calculation 
- Create visual representations of results 
11. Data Export Functionality 
- Add options to export plots and parameters
12. Performance Optimization 
- Implement Web Workers 
- Optimize React rendering 
13. Testing and Validation 
- Write unit and integration tests 
- Perform cross-browser testing 
14. Documentation 
- Write JSDoc comments and user guide 
- Document mathematical models 
15. Deployment Preparation 
- Set up production build process 
- Prepare for deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages) 
16. Future Enhancements Planning 
- Outline potential additional features 
Key Features to Implement: 
- Interactive selection and combination of SSP models 
- Real-time visualization of combined spectrum with dust attenuation 
- Ability to upload and fit observed galaxy spectra 
- Educational tooltips and explanations of key concepts 
- Calculation and display of derived galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass) 
I'm looking for assistance in developing this tool, starting with the basic React component structure and progressing through the implementation of the scientific calculations and interactive visualizations. The end goal is a fully functional, educational tool that closely mirrors the concepts taught in the ASTRO 650 course. 
When you assist me: 
1) Make sure you ask for relevant code or files that will concern with helping me and the project. Do not assume I do not have the code, ask me questions or give me ways to check (check version, if if something exists etc. ) and provide you with the output so you can understand if I have this information or should you generate it for me. 
2) Provide full code and not code snippets. If you are modifying existing code, then highlight which part of the code changes are made with 3 lines above and below as reference to be left unchanged. 
3) Go through the agenda step by step, wait for me to implement your suggested change and ask me if the output works or if there are issues or if I need help before proceeding to the next step.

2. Provide visual feedback and educational content to enhance learning 

Project Setup so far:
Created a new React application using create-react-app
Initialized a Git repository
Installed necessary dependencies (Plotly.js, react-dropzone, mathjs, tailwindcss)

Files Created:
a. src/components/SEDModelingTool.js

Main component for the SED Modeling Visualization tool
Contains the UI elements and integrates other hooks

b. src/hooks/useSSPModels.js

Custom hook to manage loading and state of SSP models
Currently uses dummy data, to be replaced with actual data loading

c. src/hooks/useSpectrumPlot.js

Custom hook to prepare data for Plotly.js visualization
Processes SSP models, combined spectrum, and galaxy spectrum for plotting

d. src/App.js (modified)

Updated to render the SEDModelingTool component


Implemented Features:

Basic structure for loading and managing SSP models
UI elements (sliders) for controlling SSP model weights and dust attenuation
Spectrum plotting functionality using Plotly.js
Real-time updating of slider values

Your tasks: 
1. Check through all the code, relevant reference material and see if user forgot to provide attachemnt or file that might help you in analysis. Then verify if proper implementation of code was done. Identify, if any, areas which might cause potential issues of if they have not been implemented properly. 
2. Study the code and make detailed guess on what the ouput and the console should show.
