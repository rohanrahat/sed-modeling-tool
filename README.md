# SED Modeling Tool

An interactive web-based application for Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) modeling and visualization in astrophysics. This tool allows students and researchers to understand how different stellar populations and dust attenuation affect a galaxy's spectrum.

## Features

- Visualization of Simple Stellar Population (SSP) models
- Interactive dust attenuation modeling
- Galaxy spectrum fitting with multiple SSPs
- Stellar mass calculation
- Upload and analyze custom galaxy spectra

## Usage

1. Visit the [SED Modeling Tool](https://rohanrahat.github.io/sed-modeling-tool) (replace with your actual URL)
2. Use the SSP Visualization section to explore different stellar population models
3. Adjust dust attenuation parameters to see their effect on spectra
4. In the Galaxy Spectrum Fitting section, upload a galaxy spectrum or use the default
5. Adjust model parameters and optimize to fit the observed spectrum

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Recharts for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
